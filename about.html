    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
      Hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. So we thought of an
      idea to create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and
      answer them accordingly with citations to the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code)
      and Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote
      areas and even urban women looking to get a consultation privately .
      <br />
      <br />
      We provide you free of cost guidance to your problems when you search them
      in our website. If you still want further legal consultation, we have a
      team of lawyers which can assist you in legal documents and frameworks.
